# W3C DID Working Group Proposal

This is a proposal for the creation of a Decentralized Identifiers Working Group
at W3C. This proposal has been put forward by a number of W3C member
companies and community groups for examination by the greater W3C
community. This work has been incubated for the past three years in
the W3C Credentials Community Group, Rebooting the Web of Trust
Design Salons, Internet Identity Workshops, and Decentralized Identity
Foundation meetings.
